Wait, uh
You're never takin' my place, uh
Get up and ride in the wave, uh
Watch how I get it and change, yuh
Keep all the tips I don't wait, uh
I tell her, "Sit on my face", yuh
Sippin' my gin, I don't chase, uh
Saving not spending the paper
Yeah!

Demons all around still, so numb I can't feel
Course you're gonna hate, your life is shit, is going down hill
