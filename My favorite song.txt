Wait, uh
You're never takin' my place, uh
Get up and ride in the wave, uh
Watch how I get it and change, yuh
Keep all the tips I don't wait, uh
I tell her, "Sit on my face", yuh
Sippin' my gin, I don't chase, uh
Saving not spending the paper
Yeah!

Getting everything I fucking asked for since the start
I get stupid paid up just for spilling out my heart
I just got a new bitch, she rides dick incredible, yeah
If she falls in love too fast, her number's getting blocked
